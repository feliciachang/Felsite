Driven by the mission to make collaboration easier between people, Thinkspaces centralizes both student led endeavors like startups, passion projects, and research along with paid on-campus jobs. We released our minimum viable product in October 2018 and our second prototype in January 2019. We now host more than 40 projects and 300+ monthly users. We entered Yaleâ€™s Spring Accelerator and won the Audience Choice Award at the final pitchoff."
            graph2="As a cofounder with both technical and design experience, I was involved with the product development process from ideation to execution. I worked on fullstack development, coding interface wireframes and features with ReactJS and a Google Firebase backend. Our working prototype gave users the ability to authenticate, build profiles, post projects, and support other projects with likes. We are currently building our third version that will support custom-built filtering and search features and micro-services using Google Cloud Functions."

            graph2="At Conservify, I contributed to the FieldKit mobile app, which allows users to interface with their FieldKit device, a sensor module composed of many different environmental sensors. Given my background in design, I was able to design prototypes in Adobe XD and build the frontend functionality. For UX, I pitched changes to navigation, building a custom tab navigation component. Prior to the change, users were only able to direct themselves from a button menu. I also participated in meetings on user experience to help develop user personas, build user journeys, and plan features. "
            graph3="Outside of making functionality changes,I also built new features and corresponding automated tests with Jest and Enzyme. One feature gave users greater customizability over their FieldKit devices by allowing them to change the name of their device through their phone, using Async Storage and an API call to the FieldKit device. Another feature let users visualize their data on a map, using the MapBox API."
