The camera, triggered with an infared sensor, will capture whatever movement it encounters. This is a boon and a curse for researchers, who now have more data than they can process."
            graph2="As a result, I was tasked with prototyping a camera trap on the edge, using Google AIY's vision project. The Google AIY comes with three core pieces of hardware: a Raspberry Pi, Vision Bonnnet used to process ML models, and a Raspberry Pi Camera. I then attached a PIR sensor and battery so that the camera can capture images autonomously. On the software side, I wrote a Python script that triggered an image capture and ran the resulting image in TensorFlow's image classification model."
            graph3="After building this simple prototype, I began to dig deeper into different machine learning models that would provide more accurate results. I conducted due diligence on the camera trap space, learning the capabilities of animal recognition today. After speaking with a researcher at Caltech, I concluded that the most practical service we could provide for a camera trap on the edge was robust object detection complemented with an array of different animal identification models based on type and ecosystem. An article on my findings is published on Conservify's Hackaday blog."
